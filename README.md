# pokedex

The coolest piece of technology in the show pokemon was the "pokedex". What does this do?

Whenever you saw a pokemon which you hadn't seen before or have no information about, you could simple whip out the pokedex and show it the pokemon to get all the info you need on the new pokemon you just found!

i've implemented this using a cnn(trained from teachable learning) and used this tflite model inside my app.

So, whenever you see a new pokemnon, just open up the app, take a photo of the pokemon and it'll give you all the information it has.

Guess what! it's totally offline :)
